# AppStore
Simulation of a simple AppStore in Java

::The app store allows anyone to browse the list of all apps, grouped in separate categories. It also runs a simple algorithm to display apps ranked by Top Free, Top Paid & Most Recent.\n
::Users need to have an account to download apps from the app store. Only users with valid accounts can login into the app store & then download apps.
::Users can give star-ratings to the apps on a scale of 1-5. However, they can only rate the apps that they have downloaded and they can rate an app only once.
::Users can further register themselves as developers and upload new apps to the app store. As developers, they can decide to either keep their app free or charge some amount of money for it to download by making it a paid app.
::As a developer, one can view the number of downloads of his/her own apps and also find out the revenue generated by his/her apps on the app store. Note that these stats are only visible to the developer of the app.
::The app store application maintains the public profile of users, showing the list of apps that they have installed. Note that if a given user also happens to be a developer, it would also show the list of apps submitted by him/her to the app store.
